Sports Video Analyzer
=====================

Idea is that you can record a video of your sport activity with your tablet or GoPro camera, then
view and analyze it with a playback view in the same app. All should run automatic and smooth, so
that you can repeat the procedure easily during your training.

Phase 1:
 implementation ongoing where I have focused on creating a video player, which allows
 playback on different speeds, frame by frame advancing and reversing. This is now somewhat
 working.


Phase 2:
 Work in progress.
 So connect to GoPro camera via Wifi and control the video recording and download to
 device, where the Phase 1 playback view can then be used to analyze video.
